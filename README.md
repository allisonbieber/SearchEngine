# SearchEngine

This project is a search engine that I built using Java, Stanford Natual Language Processing, Java Swing and Solr. The purpose of the search engine is to provide an additional sentiment filter on top of normal query processing in order to retrieve reviews of positive sentiment. The user can then obtain more useful information from the reviews.
